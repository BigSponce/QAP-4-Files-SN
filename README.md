# QAP-4-Files-SN

Included in this repository are the programs/files for each project, with notes on each project as I worked on them.
Easier readability of the notes in "code" view.

Python Notes-
I did just a few more validations than were required, but after a few extra I decided to challenge myself to make it as robust as possible without breaking the whole program (or writing dozens more lines of code, it's already past 350 lines.)
The functions took a bit of work to get figured out, I didn't practice enough with them as I would've liked prior to doing this QAP so it was a little rough but now that I've gotten the hang of it, I feel a little more comfortable with them. I always end up doing my python as soon as we're given the QAP and as soon as I hand it in, we learn something that I would've liked to add so this time I waited on it to learn a little more about data files and such. The output was really satisfying to do with the concatenated inputs and calculations to make what would've been muliple prints or variables in a single print, into one line.

Web Notes-
Admittedly, I haven't practiced a whole lot of JavaScript, but up until the output, I had a fairly straightforward time.
The output however changed most of that.
I wanted to keep clean and in a table, so I spent some time re-watching lectures and poking around W3 Schools.
I ended up using a table with 2 classes, right and left. 
This made it two columns and then using CSS to make the border between them white, effectively hiding the dividing line
The output is a little messy in terms of code, but each row is spaced apart.
The right side of the table was put a line below to keep it from being a long line of text.
All in all, a good bit of fun to figure out.
