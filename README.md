# QAP-4-Files-SN

Included in this repository are the programs/files for each project, with notes on each project as I worked on them.

Python Notes-


Web Notes-
Admittedly, I haven't practiced a whole lot of JavaScript, but up until the output, I had a fairly straightforward time.
The output however changed most of that.
I wanted to keep clean and in a table, so I spent some time re-watching lectures and poking around W3 Schools.
I ended up using a table with 2 classes, right and left. 
This made it two columns and then using CSS to make the border between them white, effectively hiding the dividing line
The output is a little messy in terms of code, but each row is spaced apart.
The right side of the table was put a line below to keep it from being a long line of text.
All in all, a good bit of fun to figure out.
